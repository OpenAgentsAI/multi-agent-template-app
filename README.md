## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or above
- **Dependencies:** Listed in requirements.txt
- **Hardware:** Minimum 4 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenAgentsAI/multi-agent-template-app.git  
   cd multi-agent-template-app 

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Initialize the environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## *Usage**

### **Adding a New Agent**
To add a new agent, create a file in the agents/ directory and define the agent logic.
Example:
```python
from zytron.platform import Agent, PlatformManager

# Define a custom agent
class CustomAgent(Agent):
    def execute(self, task):
        print(f"Executing task: {task}")

# Initialize platform and deploy agents
agent = CustomAgent(name="TaskHandler")
platform = PlatformManager(agents=[agent])
platform.run(task="Analyze blockchain transactions")
```
Register the agent in main.py:
```python
from agents.new_agent import NewAgent  

new_agent = NewAgent(name="CustomAgent")  
task_manager.register_agent(new_agent)
```

---

### **Integrating with External APIs**
To integrate with external APIs, add configuration details in the config/ directory and implement the logic in the integrations/ folder.
Example:
```python
import requests  

class CustomAPI:  
    def __init__(self, api_key):  
        self.api_key = api_key  

    def fetch_data(self, endpoint):  
        response = requests.get(endpoint, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"})  
        return response.json()
```
